Cryptomonstar is a dynamic web application that presents the most relevant data about the main cryptocurrencies in the world.

About the project:
-Motivation

Despite being a trendy topic, consumers are usually not very well informed about cryptocurrencies. 
Even though there is a lot of information about these topics, it appears that the relevant data and news are spread across the vastness of the Internet.
Cryptomonstar solves this problem by presenting the user with all of the relevant information they need to know about cryptocurrencies in one single page.

-How the problem was solved

The result of this project is a website that gathers the top fifteen cryptocurrencies of the moment and displays their main indicators in cards. 
These cards contain buttons that, when clicked, display relevant news about that specific cryptocurrency. The buttons apply filters to look for specific kind of news (e.g. bullish, bearish).
In addition, the user is allowed to search for other cryptocurrencies and add an unlimited amount of cards with the same functions to the original website.
